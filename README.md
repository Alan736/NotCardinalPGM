NotCardinalPGM
======

What is this ?
------
This is a fork of [CardinalPGM](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM) but with my own features.

#### Why didn't you send a pull request to the original repo ?
Because I planned to make CardinalPGM a plugin for a specific Minecraft server.
Example : Name of the team everywhere, custom match report with team name, ...


What I have changed from the original version
------

1. Total New Match Statistics Page
2. Redirect statistics page on my server
3. Custom MOTD
